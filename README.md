### Project Description
The SmartSense Home Automation System is an Arduino Uno-based project designed to enhance home convenience and safety through sensor-driven automation.
Automated rain sensing cloth string, Water level indicator, Gate alarm with sensor also incorporated in this project.

### The Problem statement
In modern households, managing daily activities such as monitoring water levels in overhead tanks, protecting laundry from unexpected rainfall, and ensuring home security can be time-consuming and inefficient if done manually.
	‚Ä¢	Water Tank Management: Manual monitoring of water levels often leads to water wastage due to overflow or inconvenience due to the pump being left on when not needed.
	‚Ä¢	Clothes Protection from Rain: People frequently forget to bring in their clothes when it starts raining, resulting in wet laundry, especially when they‚Äôre away from home or asleep.
	‚Ä¢	Home Security: The absence of an automatic alert system makes it difficult to detect unauthorized movements near gates, which can compromise home security.

### The Solution
To address the challenges of manual water tank monitoring, laundry protection from rain, and home security, we propose an Arduino Uno-based SmartSense Home Automation System. This system integrates multiple sensors and actuators to automate household tasks, enhance efficiency, and improve security.

Proposed Solution:
	1.	Automated Water Tank Monitoring and Control:
	‚Ä¢	A water level sensor continuously monitors the tank‚Äôs water level.
	‚Ä¢	When the water level is low, the Arduino triggers a relay module to turn ON the water pump, and a red LED indicates the low water status.
	‚Ä¢	When the tank reaches its maximum level, the pump is automatically turned OFF, and a green LED lights up to show the tank is full.
	‚Ä¢	This automation reduces water wastage, saves energy, and eliminates the need for manual supervision.
	2.	Rain-Sensing Automated Cloth Hanger System:
	‚Ä¢	A rain sensor detects the presence of rain.
	‚Ä¢	Upon detection, the Arduino sends a signal to a servo motor, which automatically pulls the laundry hanger to a sheltered area, protecting clothes from getting wet.
	‚Ä¢	When the rain stops, the hanger is returned to its original position.
	‚Ä¢	This system ensures clothes are protected even when no one is home, reducing the inconvenience of wet laundry.
	3.	Sensor-Based Gate Alarm System:
	‚Ä¢	An IR sensor detects any motion near the gate, such as a person approaching.
	‚Ä¢	When motion is detected, the Arduino activates a buzzer to alert household members of potential visitors or intrusions.
	‚Ä¢	This feature improves home security by providing real-time alerts about any movement near the entrance.

Benefits of the Solution:
	‚Ä¢	Automation: Reduces manual effort in household tasks.
	‚Ä¢	Efficiency: Optimizes water usage and energy consumption.
	‚Ä¢	Security: Enhances home safety with motion detection alerts.
	‚Ä¢	Convenience: Protects laundry automatically, even when no one is present.
	‚Ä¢	Cost-Effective: Uses affordable Arduino components and sensors, making it accessible for smart home applications.

This system offers an integrated, smart, and efficient solution for modern homes, making everyday tasks simpler and more secure.
